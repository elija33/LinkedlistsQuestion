Two numbers represented by Linked Lists Using Stack

Create 3 stacks namely stackOne, stackTwo, stackThree
Fill stackOne with Nodes of listOne.
Fill stackTwo with Nodes of listTwo.
Fill stackThree by creating new nodes and setting the data of new nodes to the sum of stackOne.top(), stackTwo.top() and carry untijl listOne and listTwo are empty.
        if the sum is greater than 9, set carry 1.
        Else, set carry 0

Create a Node(say prev) that will contain the head of the sum List.
